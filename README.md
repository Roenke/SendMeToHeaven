# ZendMeToHeaven

ZendMeToHeaven is an Android game for phun & time wasting. All you need to do is launch this app and throw your smartphone as high as you can. If you'll be able to catch it in your hands, app will show you the flight height in meters (not foots).

# HOWTO build:
---?
As simple as that. You just have to download the apk and install it on your Android device.
Note: if you suddenly have Blackberry, it obviously won't have Google Play connections and signing in.

# ZendMeToHeaven

ZendMeToHeaven is an Android game for fun & time wasting. All you need to do is launch this app and throw your smartphone as high as you can. If you are able to catch it in your hands, app will show you the flight height in meters (not foots). Moreover, this app has achievements and leaderboard, so you can compete with your friends!

## HOWTO play:

As simple as that. You just have to download the apk and install it on your Android device.
Note: if you suddenly have Blackberry, it obviously won't have Google Play connections and signing in, but you still can play it.

## Problems:
- Because of not clearly determined moment of throw, sometimes it shows not such good results as you wanted.
- Don't throw it down! It's not supposed to calculate "depth" of falling!
